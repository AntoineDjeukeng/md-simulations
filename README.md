Molecular Dynamics Toolkit for Solid-Liquid Interfaces
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for conducting molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid interfaces, focusing on carbon-based structures. It includes resources and scripts for efficiently setting up and running simulations using LAMMPS and GROMACS, two of the most powerful and widely used molecular dynamics simulation packages.

Features
Detailed Carbon Structure Modeling: Tools and techniques for accurately modeling carbon structures at solid-liquid interfaces.
Input File Generation: Automated scripts to create well-structured input files for LAMMPS and GROMACS.
Simulation Setup: Guidelines and templates for setting up various types of interface simulations, including system preparation, parameterization, and simulation protocols.
Analysis and Visualization: Post-processing scripts for analyzing simulation outcomes and visualizing complex interactions at the interface.
Applications
The toolkit is particularly useful for researchers and students in materials science, computational chemistry, and related fields. Key applications include:

Investigating the behavior of fluids at solid interfaces.
Studying the properties of carbon-based materials in different environmental conditions.
Exploring chemical reactions and dynamics at solid-liquid boundaries.
